# DOA Estimation using CNN and Attention-based GRU with NCA Based Feature Selection

This repository contains MATLAB code for **Direction of Arrival (DOA) estimation**
using a hybrid deep learning approach that combines **CNN**, **Attention-based GRU**,
and **Neighborhood Component Analysis (NCA) Based feature selection** Algorithm.

## Parameters
- **K**: Number of snapshots  
- **d**: Distance between antenna elements (normalized by wavelength)
- **SNR**: Signal to Noise Ratio

By adjusting the parameters **K**, **d** and **SNR**, the output results for different scenarios can be reproduced.
